# pentest-bash-repo
A simple shell script to download all the github tools I use in pentesting / CTF 

## Use 
This script is used when setting up a new linux machine for pentesting or CTF's. Basically this just downloads all the tools i've added to machines in the past, making it much faster then just downloading one by one.
